# üè¶ eBank


I was away from my computer and the internet for about 3 months due to the blackout caused by the war going on in my home country. After things calmed and the electricity restored I challenged myself to implement in **Flutter** the UI design I found from [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/16682506-Payoo-Mobile-App "Dribble"). I came accross this clean good looking design and decided to implement it.
